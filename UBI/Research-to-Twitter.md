Universal Basic Income And The Blockchain In Government -- Research-Based Opinions


#money #beneficiary #incentive #grow 
        
    Creating a decent basic income system now, even if it had only a little money in it at first, would give every potential beneficiary an incentive to see it grow. [5]
        
    One way or another, creating a decent basic income system now, even if it had only a little money in it at first, would give every potential beneficiary an incentive to see it grow. [5]
        
    There are strong arguments both in favor and against basic income, but rather little evidence as to how people actually reach and behave when they get unconditional guaranteed income. [0]

    His response, of course, is software -- in particular, Group Currency, a specification for online currency systems that provide basic income - like distributions of funds to all their users. [5]
        
    But there are other digital currencies being developed or discussed that include their own variants on the basic income idea, including the Kiwicoin in New Zealand, Cubecoin, Strangecoin, the Worldwide Globals Organization, and the Basic Income Project, LLC. [5]
        
    Over the past few months, basic income advocates tinkering with Bitcoin and other online currencies have created a series of experiments under the premise that we can start playing with basic income now, whether the government gets in on it or not. [5]
        
    This is a defining challenge for basic income schemes based on cryptocurrencies, and some have addressed it more convincingly than others. [5]

    Activists could also target entities that take advantage of the commons -- energy companies, internet giants, pharmaceutical firms profiting from publicly funded research -- and hold sit - ins outside their doors until they pay into the fund. [5]
        
    While by now most people have long accepted the notion that all of our activity is tracked and monitored by a plethora of private corporations, enabling the government to have an open and instant socket into our every move is, for some at least, rather unnerving. [13]
        
    


#UBI #concept #resources #idea 
        
    By simply giving away money, today blockchain UBI activists also underline something radical about the basic income concept that extends back to Paine. [2]
        
    The team behind Circles argues that "the concept of a UBI is not just compatible but the foundation of a fair money. [2]
        
    I 've been interested in the concept of Universal Basic Income since I first heard about it a good few years back. [11]
        
    At its core, Larimer's philosophy is based on the idea that no one person is entitled to earth's resources, and that wealth built from these resources could be redistributed over a set period of time utilizing his proposed plan for universal resource inheritance. [7]
        
    In recent weeks, Larimer, a long - time supporter of an idea similar to universal basic income, what he calls "universal resource inheritance ", has been involved in a number of lengthy conversations on the subject. [7]
        
    


#blockchain #Bitcoin #technologies #assets 
        
    Being the first publicly - traded cryptocurrency and blockchain - centered company, we provide our shareholders with diversified exposure to digital cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. [17]
        
    Our team has been building a framework for delivering global, sustainable, and scalable UBI through new digital asset technologies, namely blockchain. [15]
        
    First Bitcoin Capital Corp. The most significant of the transferences of these cryptocurrencies to Bots Inc., included, but was not limited to, the majority ownership of First Bitcoin ( COIN : BIT ), a cryptocurrency based on a unique blockchain similar to an improved version of Litecoin. [17]
        
    First Bitcoin Capital Corp ( OTC : BITCF ) is the largest shareholder of Bots, Inc. as a result of exchanging the majority of its assets therefor, but began developing digital currencies, proprietary blockchain technologies, and the digital currency exchange -A www. [17]
        
    


#means #cash #individuals #testing 
        
    UBI is a regular cash payment to individuals, without being subject to means testing or requiring any form of work to qualify. [12]
        
    There's no means - testing, no sanctions if the subjects become employed or generate an income from freelance working during the trial. [12]
        
    Like basic income, it guarantees everyone ( where everyone can mean, for example, all adult citizens of a country ) a certain amount of regular income. [8]
        
    The IMF describes universal basic income as an income support mechanism, in which regular cash payments are intended to reach all ( or a very large ) portion of the population with no ( or minimal ) conditions. [16]
        
    An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs ( at or above the poverty line ), is called full basic income, while if it is less than that amount, it is called partial. [8]
        
    


#government #implementation #control #Russia 
        
    Barely a day goes by without reports of another country -- China, India, and Russia most notable among them -- decreeing the eventual implementation of government backed cryptocurrency. [13]
        
    As long as governments remain the presiding entities controlling our society, the laws they enact will largely dictate the future implementation and usage of crypto. [13]
        
    While many cryptocurrencies currently exist, we have seen governments like China and Russia ban their use in one fell swoop, rendering them illegal while promising a forthcoming release of their own official digital currencies. [13]
        
    Ironically, the very tools that were built with visions of freedom and autonomy may very well be the implement of choice for a new level of surveillance and control. [13]
        
    While there are many clear benefits in having government backed crypto, there may be a few drawbacks to centralized implementation of a technology originally conceived by anti - authoritarian anarchists. [13]
        
    


#benefits #work #jobs #activities 
        
    The idea is to test if the carrot works better than the stick in encouraging the unemployed to accept new jobs offers and to seek income from entrepreneur activities. [0]
        
    The basic income cash sum will replace the existing flat rate unemployment benefits and will continue to be paid even if they take up jobs. [0]
        
    Since 1970s, social policies on both sides of the Atlantic have been dominated by workfare policies where the payment of benefits is made conditional on participation in job promoting activities such as training, rehabilitation and work experience, or on unpaid or low - paid work. [0]
        
    An additional advantage is that recipients of this basic income do not need to report their incomes to the unemployment office, which reduces bureaucracy and the insecurity caused by fluctuating benefit levels. [0]
        
    


#University #Economist #economics #told #CNBC 
        
    Guy Standing, a research professor in development studies at SOAS, University of London, told CNBC via telephone that there was no prospect of a global economic revival without a universal basic income. [16]
        
    Cailin Birch, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC via telephone that Spain's decision to roll out a universal basic income could pave the way for other countries to follow suit. [16]
        
    Economists at RMIT University in Melbourne and the University of Queensland, in Australia, have proposed a system that eliminates the need for centralized pooling : a personal equity swap. [2]
        
    At the end of March, a post on the World Economic Forum website admitted that UBI had moved from the "fringes of mainstream economics" to center stage, because of COVID-19. [15]

    Participants validate their identity based consensus of participant singularity and humanity; validated participants are granted an ERC725 citizenship with the right to participate in the Democracy Earth Network. [14]
        
    The growing support for UBI resonates with the Democracy Earth vision behind The Social Smart Contract and the development of our tokenized liquid democracy platform. [14]
        
    A token - based liquid democracy model fights corruption by allowing citizens full control over their votes to accurately signal their priorities. [14]
        
    Democracy Earth's VOTE token provides a highly implementable version of a Universal Basic Income that is easy to distribute, easy to audit, and provides both political and economic liquidity. [14]
        
    In the Democracy Earth network this liquidity is provided in the form of a VOTE token, operating on a mobile, open source blockchain - based governance platform ( alpha release name : Sovereign ). [14]
        
    


#m #app #sell #buy #wants 
        
    If I 'm the only person who wants to buy the new "iPhone Zillion," perhaps I 'd have to pay $ 1B ( likely more ) for it. [10]
        
    The same is true for app developers who can now give apps away for free or sell them for just a few dollars while still making a profit. [10]
        
    But since there are millions of people who would want to buy that phone, Apple can sell it for hundreds of dollars and yet make a lot of money. [10]
        
    


#year #receive #state #age #Alaska 
        
    The report stated that all adults -- those over the age of 18 -- would receive R$600 ( $ 113 ) per month. [15]
        
    If an adolescent of less than 18 years of age has a child, she ( or he ) will also receive the benefit ( of R$1200 ). [15]
        
    Yang proposed for the United States to set a guaranteed payment of $ 1,000 per month, or $ 12,000 per year, to all U.S. citizens over the age of 18. [4]
        
    Alaska already has a basic income - like program with its Permanent Fund, which pays out about $ 1,000 in dividends from the state's oil revenues to every resident, every year. [5]
        
    The airwaves add about 2.5 percent to the nation's GDP every year, which Barnes calculates adds up to about $ 418 billion on an average year. [2]
        
    


#currency #inflation #money #supply #price 
        
    Increasing the money supply could cause price inflation, but it doesn't always have to, even with traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar. [10]
        
    In other words, if we could successfully bootstrap a crypto UBI currency, the deflationary pressure resulting from that currency's appreciation would offset the price inflation resulting from increases in the money supply. [10]
        
    And with a ShrinkToken UBI, monetary inflation would decrease over time as the incremental increases in the money supply are increasingly smaller in proportion to the total money supply. [10]
        
    If we fund a UBI through creating more tokens ( i.e., expanding the money supply ), then that would cause monetary inflation, which isn't the same thing as price inflation. [10]
        
    Even if you assume at 100 % correlation of monetary and price inflation, my worksheet shows that a Haitian ShrinkToken's monetary inflation rate would dip below the historical Haitian price inflation ( 12.3 % ) in less than a decade. [10]
        
    


#Elon #Musk #intelligence #cows #future 
        
    Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders have spoken positively of the concept, as have tech titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. [2]
        
    And, Elon Musk recently said that maybe we have no alternative but to actually implement some kind of a basic income. [3]
        
    Oren Etzioni, CEO of The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, states of artificial intelligence's effect on society, "There will be very real disruption. [1]
        
    So yes, I think a situation as extraordinary as this one calls for certain sacred cows from the past to be reconsidered as sacred cows. [3]
        
    Elon Musk explained in a speech at the World Government Summit in 2017, "There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot can not do better," adding, "I want to be clear. [7]
        
    


#experiment #group #result #Finland 
        
    The concept of basic income gathered interest from legislators and governments in the US and Canada in the 1970 resulting in local experiments, but the experiment in Finland is the first nation - wide randomized field experiment on the idea. [0]
        
    If there will be differences after the experiment between the treatment group and the control group, we can establish a causal loop. [0]
        
    Results from a universal basic income experiment in Dauphin, Manitoba showed that life in this Canadian city improved markedly, in terms of health and education, during the experiment a especially among disadvantaged families. [0]
        
    Since the treatment group getting the atreatmenta, i.e. the a!560 a month net, is similar to the control group in all relevant back ground characteristics, the experiment mimics experiments in natural sciences and in medicine. [0]
        
    


#jobs #automation #work #people #displaced 
        
    Itas clear that the changing nature of work, driven by new technologies, will require us to rethink how we provide support to people who are displaced. [6]
        
    As globalization and technology eliminate jobs or jobs continue to become less secure, an increasing number of people will be unable to make ends meet with earnings from employment. [0]
        
    This shows that even as more people are employed working in tech that may have displaced them from their last jobs, they will be paid an even smaller amount of the value they are creating and inequality will continue to worsen. [14]
        
    In the tech capital of the U.S., San Francisco, over 40 percent of all jobs could become automated in the same timeframe. [7]
        
    There are a whole raft of white collar jobs including legal, insurance, trading and banking which could be automated in the next few years. [11]
        
    


#legacy #Luther #King #Martin #problems 
        
    The legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will always be one in which he is remembered for his undeniable role in the civil rights movement. [4]
        
    It is now over 50 years since Dr. Martin Luther King has passed away, and his fight for equality and ending poverty has remained unresolved. [4]
        
    It is worthwhile to think how Martin Luther King Jr. would have made sense of a solution that involves tokenizing the National Reserves and federal energy assets, in order to remedy some of the problems that plague poverty - stricken people. [4]
        
    The media focus of inner - city problems only truly exists for a few fleeting months every four years when Presidential candidates sense opportunity and offer promises and solutions to problems that have plagued generations, and after November little is accomplished leaving residents from those communities frustrated and helpless. [4]
        
    


#Yang #Andrew #president #candidate #policy 
        
    One presidential candidate -- Andrew Yang, a former entrepreneurship ambassador under Obama -- is even basing his entire 2020 campaign around UBI. [2]
        
    But it has gained more traction of late, more recently through the likes of U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who based his platform on the policy. [16]
        
    The idea of Universal Basic Income became a popular policy again in 2019 when Andrew Yang, who ran for president as a Democrat, announced he would implement a guaranteed income if he were to become president. [4]
        
    Andrew Yang is one of 19 Democrats who have declared their candidacy for president in the 2020 US election, but he is the only candidate so far who has incorporated blockchain into a major tenet of his platform. [9]
        
    


#crisis #government #economy #Federal #world 
        
    The current Federal stimulus plan will push too many Americans into poverty and relies heavily upon the Federal government for their survival. [4]
        
    The Federal Government's one - dimensional inner - city federal housing policy had unintended consequences, including displacing residents, demoralizing communities, and creating concentrations of poverty, unemployment, and crime. [4]
        
    To be sure, the International Monetary Fund now expects the global economy in 2020 to suffer its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. [16]
        
    And let's not forget last year, in 2019, out of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world, six were in sub - Saharan Africa. [3]
        
    Standing urged world leaders and policymakers to avoid repeating the same mistakes that were made in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, saying another "toxic combination" of austerity and quantitative easing would simply stoke up another crisis. [16]
        
    


#year #pandemic #start #people #contact 
        
    There's a thesis emerging that amid the terrible pandemic challenges, people are more receptive to a wider range of policy options now than they were at the start of the year. [3]
        
    What we will see, however, is increasing amounts of data over the coming years, which will start to demonstrate how larger schemes could be deployed. [12]
        
    They know how to do contact tracing because of Ebola and because of other epidemics that they 've had to deal with over the last 10 years. [3]
        
    Now hordes of others -- across the political divide, crucially -- are joining the conversation, owing to the financial dire straits many millions of people find themselves because of the pandemic. [15]
        
    Brancaccio : Is there a case [ to be made ] that the range of economic policies has widened in this year of pandemic and the new energy we're seeing in the social justice movement? [3]
